    var total = prompt('How many km are left to go?')
    if (total > 100){
         console.log("We still have a bit of driving left to go");
    } 
    else if (50 < total && total <= 100){
        console.log("We'll be there in 5 minutes");
    }
    else 
        console.log("I'm parking. I'll see you right now");
